Currently can be (at least) used to play through the entire campaign, **multiplayer is not tested**

# Installation and usage
Install Visual C++ Redist https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe

Place files from https://github.com/RollinBarrel/binary-domaim/releases/latest/download/domaim.zip inside the game's folder (**C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Binary Domain\\** by default)

If you've used an earlier version of the mod, delete your old **dom.aim** file inside the game's folder

To adjust mod's settings, you can use **domaim.exe** (you can also adjust the settings while the game is running)
Alternatively, when in game, use **+/-** or **Num+/Num-** to adjust your base sensitivity, current sensitivity then will be shown in the HUD instead of the ammo counter for a brief period
