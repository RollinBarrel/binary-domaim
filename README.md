# binary-domaim
Mod for Binary Domain aimed at improving mouse aiming

Currently can be (at least) used to play through the entire campaign, **multiplayer is not tested**

# Installation and usage
Put **DINPUT8.dll** file from [here](https://github.com/RollinBarrel/binary-domaim/releases/latest) inside the game's folder (**C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Binary Domain\\** by default)

When in game, use **+/-** or **Num+/Num-** to adjust your sensitivity, current sensitivity then will be shown in the HUD instead of the ammo counter for a brief period
